\* CFG CONSTANT one_calls = {A, B}
\* CFG CONSTANT two_calls = {C}

\* This test checks for a previously-existing bug where a module with two entry
\* procedures would use the first two procedures as the entry points instead of
\* the actual annotated procedures.

@entry
proc one() {
}

proc unused() {
    assert FALSE;
}

@entry
proc two() {
}
